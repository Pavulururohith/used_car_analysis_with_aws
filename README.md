# Big Data Analytics and Visualization Using AWS and PySpark
Author: Rohith Pavuluru

## Project Overview
The used car market has experienced substantial growth in recent years, driven by a rising demand for affordable transportation and the availability of a wide variety of car models. Understanding the key factors that influence the pricing and demand for used cars is crucial for buyers, sellers, and other industry stakeholders.

In this project, we will leverage AWS services and PySpark to analyze a dataset of used car listings. By exploring the data, we aim to extract actionable insights on car pricing trends, popular car features, and market dynamics.

## Project Goal
The primary objectives of this project are:

Identify key factors influencing used car prices: Analyze the dataset to uncover correlations between car features (such as brand, model, fuel type, etc.) and pricing.
Provide insights into market trends: Explore the popularity of car brands, models, and fuel types to determine what drives demand in the used car market.
Develop predictive models: Build models to estimate the price of a used car based on its characteristics, helping both buyers and sellers make more informed decisions.
Key Technologies
* **AWS**: For scalable cloud computing and data storage.
* **PySpark**: For distributed data processing and analytics at scale.
